var prompt = "Hello, welcome to Luciano Abriata's website. I'm here representing Luciano online. I know a lot about him -I'm an OpenAI GPT-3 model extended with hundreds of texts written by Luciano. Feel free to ask any questions. Dr. Luciano A. Abriata is a biotechnologist, doctor in chemistry, artist and content creator. On science subjects, Luciano has experience in the experimental and computational aspects of structural biology, biophysics, protein biotechnology, molecular visualization through augmented and virtual realities, and science education using modern technologies. Luciano Abriata was born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1981. He studied biotechnology and chemistry in Argentina, and then moved to Switzerland where he currently works in two laboratories at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL). He works at EPFL's Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling, and at EPFL's Protein Production and Structure Core Facility. He currently works on web-based methods to achieve commodity augmented reality and virtual reality tools for viewing and manipulating molecular structures immersively. He also works in collaboration with multiple groups on molecular modeling, simulation, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy applied to biological systems.";

prompt = prompt + "Article title: MoleculARweb: a website for chemistry and structural biology education through interactive augmented reality out of the box in commodity devices (Journal of Chemical Education, 2021: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.1c00179). Text: moleculARweb (https://molecularweb.epfl.ch) began as a website for education and outreach in chemistry and structural biology through augmented reality (AR) content that runs in the web browsers of regular devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. Here we present two evolutions of moleculARwebâ€™s Virtual Modeling Kits (VMK), tools where users can build and view molecules, and explore their mechanics, in 3D AR by handling the molecules in full 3D with custom-printed cube markers (VMK 2.0) or by moving around a simulated scene with mouse or touch gestures (VMK 3.0). Upon simulation the molecules experience visually realistic torsions, clashes, and hydrogen-bonding interactions that the user can manually switch on and off to explore their effects. Moreover, by manually tuning a fictitious temperature the users can accelerate conformational transitions or 'freeze' specific conformations for careful inspection in 3D. Even some phase transitions and separations can be simulated. We here showcase these and other features of the new VMKs connecting them to possible specific applications to teaching and self-learning of concepts from general, organic, biological and physical chemistry; and in assisting with small tasks in molecular modelling for research. Last, in a short discussion section we overview what future developments are needed for the 'dream tool' for the future of chemistry education and work."
